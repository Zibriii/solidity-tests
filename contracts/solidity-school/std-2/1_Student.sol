Problem Statement
Write a contract 'Student' which implements a function named enroll.

enroll() takes student roll number (uint)and student name (string) as parameters and store them in a one to one mapping. Also emit en event on success with student roll number.

Informational Hint
Mapping
You declare mapping types with the syntax mapping(_KeyType => _ValueType). The _KeyType can be any elementary type. This means it can be any of the built-in value types plus bytes and string. _ValueType can be any type, including mappings.

Mappings can only have a data location of storage and thus are allowed for state variables, as storage reference types in functions, or as parameters for library functions. They cannot be used as parameters or return parameters of contract functions that are publicly visible.

Events
Solidity events give an abstraction on top of the EVM’s logging functionality. Applications can subscribe and listen to these events through the RPC interface of an Ethereum client.

Events are inheritable members of contracts. When you call them, they cause the arguments to be stored in the transaction’s log - a special data structure in the blockchain.
